# CyberPi 

CyberPi is a main control board independently developed by Makeblock. 
With the compact structure and built-in ports, it can easily be extended. 
It supports mBlock 5 and mBlock-Python Editor, and it is applicable to multiple education scenarios including large-class teaching, 
community teaching, and online/offline education and training. It covers multiple teaching fields including coding, makers, and robots, 
and thus it can meet diversified education needs, such as AI, IoT, data science, and UI design.
